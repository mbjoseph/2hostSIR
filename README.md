Interactive two host SIR model
========================================================

This is an example of interfacing R, shiny, and deSolve to produce an interactive environment where users can explore 
the behavior of a moderately complex epidemiological model by altering parameters in an easy to use GUI. For another
example of such an interface, see [this example using Lorentz's equations](http://grrrraphics.blogspot.com/2013/01/shiny-desolve-and-ggplot-play-nicely.html).
